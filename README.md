# UnitTwoHomework
02-CSS-Bootstrap
In this project I was able to mostly recreate my porfolio from week one.  I learned a lot about coding throughout doing this homework and I also learened just how important time management is when it comes to coding. I was able to make responsive webpage with images that move when the webpage is minimized and when the website is viewed on a mobile screeen using bootstrap.  At the end I ran into a big issue where I could not get the porfolio page to straighten out but after an hour or two I finally found the one typo that was causing me grief.
